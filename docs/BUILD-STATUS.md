# BUILD STATUS

Updated by Claude Code at the end of every session. The owner reads this file to know where the
project actually stands. A row is only `DONE` when its acceptance criteria have executed tests.

## Session-0 close-out notes

- `tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php` (Laravel scaffolding, `GET /`) was replaced by
  `tests/Feature/HealthEndpointTest.php` (`GET /up`): Stage 2 installs no Node and builds no
  assets, so the Inertia root view's `@vite` had no manifest and 500'd on every clean runner
  (CI run 30307818550) while passing locally. The full Inertia render stays proven by Stages 3–4.
- `tests/Integration/StackSmokeTest.php` lost **every** silent `localhost` fallback — Redis first,
  then Postgres and the app/Reverb HTTP checks. A host service on a published port (a native
  redis-server on 6379, an unrelated Postgres on 5432) would answer and be asserted against with
  the stack up and healthy. All five endpoints now resolve container DNS only through
  `stackEndpoint()`; the suite is container-only (`make test`) and fails with an explicit message.
- Dev source delivery changed (ADR 0002): `docker/compose.dev.yaml` bind-mounts the working tree
  into app/worker/scheduler/reverb, and `make test` depends on a new `make reload`. CI does not
  load the override. This fixes `make test` executing a *deleted* test from the baked image during
  this close-out.

## Deferred with reason

_(Claude Code appends here. Every deferral needs a spec id and a reason.)_

## Open blockers

_(Claude Code appends here. Only the owner can clear these.)_

- **Dev host: native `redis-server` is STILL enabled and running.** Reported disabled by the owner
  twice; verified otherwise three times. Evidence at the last check: `is-active: active`,
  `is-enabled: enabled`, `PING → PONG` on `127.0.0.1:6379`, and — decisively — the enable symlink
  `/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/redis-server.service` still carries its original
  install mtime of **2026-04-06 18:03:48**. `systemctl disable` removes that symlink, so it has
  never run successfully on this filesystem. The host rebooted at 2026-07-28 18:58:27 and redis
  autostarted two seconds later, which is what an *enabled* unit does. Most likely the command ran
  in a different WSL distro or errored unnoticed (`WSL_DISTRO_NAME=Ubuntu`, hostname `Kidus`).
  Owner action: re-run it with the output visible (`! sudo systemctl disable --now redis-server`)
  so the result is in the transcript, then the port can be reclaimed. **Impact is now bounded**:
  no test can silently reach it (`stackEndpoint()` forbids every localhost fallback), but S1
  application code run from the host against `localhost:6379` still would. CI is unaffected —
  runners have no native Redis.
